Contributions:

Abi Davis - Coded "back end" methods in game class, PlayerScore, implemented ArrayList structure throughout

Lance Keith - Designed all the GUI

Maggie Hagan - Coded the connections from the GUI screen to the actual code

Note: This was truly a group effort. Everyone really did their fair share of work and was involved in the

whole process. It could be said everyone was involved in every part of it in some way.

 

Running: Download files and import into a development environment, run the program,

follow the prompts along to play our game and see if you would survive 2020.

 

Testing:

We did a lot of testing by adding print lines throughout to make sure we were getting expected values.

Print lines were removed for clarity of the code.

Ran many test runs of the code by clicking things in different orders which came out with the expected outcomes

Manually input scores to make sure the expected outcome was selected

Tested closing out of program part way through to confirm it closes smoothly

 
Aim:

Our purpose was to create a fun interaactive game to allow end users who lived through or heard of the tough year that was 2020 in a positive way.
